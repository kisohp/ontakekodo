			We found something like water place which is on the pamphlet. We thought we’d already passed Gouya  and Chigono, but after passing Kohan bridge, there were Gouya  and Chigono on the right side. These places on the pamphlet are not correct and we could find the right water place in the end. 
				At first glance, Gouya  and Chigono are similar, though there is a big difference like its shape, color and size.

				<p>Review of Ontake Kodo</p>
				
				
				
				
			</div>
			<div class="sen">
				

				We walked Ontake Kodo from Gyonin Bridge to Oedo. It was in July 6th and raining a little.
				
				Gyonin Bridge looked very old, but there is an illumination attached to this bridge. (it didn’t work then)
				Tourists should be careful, when walking on the bridge because it was very slippery. As we stood on the middle of the bridge, the view of both sides was very great, so you can enjoy the flow of the river even if it’s a rainy day.  
				
				We could not find Saikoji ②, but there were many places named Saikoji---, so it might not be the name of the temple but the name of an area. If you look for the temple, please remember it.
				
				As we walked, we expected Gouya ③ and Chigono ④ were just around the corner, but we couldn’t find them. On the contrary, we found something like water place which is on the pamphlet. We thought we’d already passed ③ and ④, but after passing Kohan bridge, there were ③ and ④ on the right side. These places on the pamphlet are not correct we could find the right water place in the end though. 
				
				At first glance, ③ and ④ are similar, though there is a big difference like its shape, color and size.
				
				
				It takes longer than expected to get to each place, so it might be better for you to find your own way to enjoy Ontake Kodo.  
				For example, we tried to look for the spot which are not written on the pamphlet such as many stone monuments, waterfalls and some shutters that famous Sumo wrestler are painted on.  They fascinated us very much.
